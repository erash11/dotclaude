# Shell / Environment (macOS)

- **Terminal app: Ghostty** (Eric, 2026-11-02; `/Applications/Ghostty.app`, 1.4.0). Hand Eric commands to paste in Ghostty. To start a new session or a long job in a window, run `open -na Ghostty --args --working-directory=<dir> -e <cmd>` (or `open -a Ghostty <file>.command`). Exception: `com.keystone.clouddrivepush` stays on Terminal, because macOS grants Drive file access to Terminal (Tier A `cloud-push-launchd-blocked`).
- zsh/bash is the native surface on this machine. PowerShell 7 (`pwsh`, `/opt/homebrew/bin/pwsh`) is installed only to run the KeystoneOS `.ps1` jobs natively.
- **The tool-path list has one home: `~/.claude/TOOLPATHS.md`.** Read that file when you need a path. Only the traps below are kept, because acting on them wrongly is expensive.
- **Verify, don't trust any list.** `which -a <tool>` is authoritative. To read PATH honestly, scrub the environment first:
  `env -i HOME="$HOME" USER="$USER" TERM=xterm SHELL=/bin/zsh /bin/zsh -lic 'echo $PATH'`
- Traps:
  - Python is PEP 668-managed. Use venvs or `uv`, never `pip install` globally.
  - `uv` is a standalone install at `~/.local/bin/uv`, **not** Homebrew. Claude Code hooks call `$HOME/.local/bin/uv`; do not delete or relocate it.
  - `timeout` is NOT installed (no GNU coreutils). Don't use it in scripts.
  - Homebrew owns `/opt/homebrew/bin`. `/usr/local/bin` is empty and stays that way.
  - Secrets live in the macOS Keychain, not in `~/.zshrc`.
- DEV projects live at `~/DEV` (not `~/Desktop/DEV`). Workspace map: `~/DEV/CLAUDE.md`.
- Primary storage drive (documents, data, deliverables): `~/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-eric.rash11@gmail.com/My Drive/00_Primary_Storage_Drive`.
- Paths that differ from Windows:
  - SecondBrain vault: `~/SecondBrain` (Windows: `~/Desktop/SecondBrain`).
  - Workspace memory (Tier A for `DEV`): `~/.claude/projects/-Users-kristinarash-DEV/memory/`.
  - Printing-press CLIs: `~/go/bin/`.
