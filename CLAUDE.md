# Machine

Machine-specific shell, paths, and traps live in `~/.claude/machine.md` (gitignored; copy `machine.macos.md` or `machine.windows.md` to `machine.md` on a new machine). It is imported below.

@machine.md

Projects sync through GitHub (`erash11`), documents through Google Drive.

**Session routine.** When working inside a project repo, follow the Session routine in its `AGENTS.md`: `git pull` and read `docs/STATUS.md` at the start; update `STATUS.md`, commit, and `git push` at the end. This keeps the cloud sessions and any other machine in step.

# Workflow Expectations

- When asked to **create, merge, or consolidate an artifact** (calendar, deck, doc), finish with the produced file in hand. Check what exists first, then build the file even when a similar one already exists.
- **Saving, moving, or backing up a file** → read `~/.claude/STORAGE.md` first. It says where each kind of file lives.
- When the user types `/graphify`, invoke the Skill tool with `skill: "graphify"` before doing anything else.
- Skills are tools: invoke one when it clearly fits the task.
- **A command handed to Eric runs when pasted from any folder**: absolute paths, no `<placeholders>` (Eric, 2026-11-02; a repo-relative path and a `<words>` placeholder both failed in zsh that week).
- **Auditing or improving a skill, `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`**: load `mattpocock-skills:writing-for-agents` first (Eric, 2026-11-02; he asked for it 3 times in a week).
- **Decisions for Eric go on the Decision Desk** (Eric, 2026-11-02): https://claude.ai/artifact/SKUir7NZtM8NN5gwohEn3u. Seed each one with ArtifactData (2 options max, Claude's pick marked), read his clicks back from `answers`, and still list them in one line each in chat with the link. Format and fields: Tier A `feedback_decision-desk.md`. One standing page; never make a new one.
- **Writing code: climb the reuse ladder** and stop at the first rung that fully works: (1) does it need to exist at all; (2) already in this codebase, used the way the surrounding code uses it; (3) standard library or platform feature; (4) an installed dependency; (5) one line a reader gets at a glance; (6) only then, the minimum new code.
  - Read the code the change touches first, and finish every caller, test and fixture it breaks. Validation at trust boundaries, error handling that prevents data loss, and security stay in.
  - New logic with a branch, loop, parser, money or security leaves one small test or assert.
  - A shortcut with a known limit gets a comment: `shortcut: <the limit>, <when to upgrade>`.
  - End a coding reply with one or two lines: what was skipped or not checked, and any risk Eric must know. (Adapted from ponytail, 2026-10-20.)
- **Non-code work: decision rules** (Eric's answers, 2026-10-22):
  - Staff-facing writing: action first, clarity over polish, one page.
  - Coach reports and dashboards: open with the decision the report supports, then only the data for it.
  - Tools for staff: build on what Baylor already runs (Teams, Box, Excel, Teamworks).
  - Fast vs. thorough: thorough and checked for admin and supervisors; a small version first for coaches and Eric's own tools.
  - When Eric hands over a solution (from a video, or a named tool), restate the goal it serves, keep his idea on the table, and name a better fit if one exists before building.

# Session Startup

The `keystone-unified-snapshot.js` SessionStart hook injects `global-memory/USER.md`, `global-memory/MEMORY.md`, a summary of `transcripts/.errors.log` (only when non-empty), and a pointer to the KeystoneOS snapshot. Work from the injected copy.

- If hook failures appear, surface them once on the first response, then continue. Entries mean a hook or scheduled job failed.
- If a **"SessionStart hook could not read a required memory file"** block appears, say so on the first response.
- **If no `## User profile` block is in context at session start, the hook did not fire.** Say so, then read `USER.md`, `MEMORY.md` and `transcripts/.errors.log` by hand.
- The injection is a frozen snapshot: mid-session writes take effect next session. Load anything further only when a question needs it.

# Memory — routing only

The two-tier memory system (`~/.claude/global-memory/` and `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/memory/`) is owned by the **`memory-write` skill**, which holds the tier rules, character caps, slug rules, write steps, retrieval ladder, and daily-compiled-log rules.

The active project's Tier A memory (`~/.claude/projects/<slug>/memory/`, indexed by its `MEMORY.md`) is **auto-injected by the harness** each session. recall.py reads every Tier A folder, so they stay recallable across projects.

- Writing a fact — "remember this", "note that", "save this", "forget about" → `Skill("memory-write")`
- Recalling past context — "did we already…?", "what did we decide about X" → `Skill("memory-write")`, Recall section
- Daily compiled logs at `~/.claude/claude-memory-compiler/daily/` are written only by `claude-memory-compiler`. Read one only when a question needs that day.
- **Slugs are path-based** (Mac `-Users-kristinarash-DEV-<X>`). Tier A is not auto-injected in cloud sessions or on another machine; memsearch still finds it. Durable project facts belong in the repo's `docs/` so every session sees them.

---

Maintainer note: `AGENTS.md` diverges from this file on purpose (Codex has no Skill tool, so it spells out the memory rules). Keep them as separate files; the memory procedure's one home is the `memory-write` skill.

## Repo changes

Before working in any repo, read ~/DEV/REPO_CHANGES_GUIDE.md (plain summary: renames, archives, the forecast archive merge, what was left alone, rules, and how to undo). ~/DEV/REPO_CHANGES.md is the full log with the exact undo command for each change. GitHub names changed but local folder names did not. Run `git remote -v` before pushing, never push to an archived repo, and log every new change in REPO_CHANGES.md with its undo before making it.
